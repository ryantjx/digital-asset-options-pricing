## Motivation
Recently, I had an interview for a FX and Rates markets strategy team. During the interview, my biggest difficulty was generating a fair value. I was tasked with generating a Fair Value for a Futures contract, a question I completely fumbled. Next, I was asked to price the cost of a second-hand car. I fumbled that too. The answer was just price of COE * Tax Rebate something along that lines. What I also realized, is that I actually did something like this. I attempted to price an options contract using the Black-Scholes Model, but I stopped because "the problem got too complex" and "nobody uses the Black-Scholes Model". After experiencing this setback, I was so frustrated at myself. These are things that should be at the tips of my fingers! And so, this is my journey on learning to price digital asset options.
