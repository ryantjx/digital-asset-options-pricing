    "# 1.1.1.2 Black-Scholes-Merton Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Partial Differential Equation\n",
    "The Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model is a mathematical framework used to price options and other derivative securities. At its core is a partial differential equation (PDE) that describes how the price of a derivative evolves over time.\n",
    "The BSM PDE for the price $V(S,t)$ of an option is:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 S^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} + rS\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} = rV$$\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $S$ = underlying asset price\n",
    "- $t$ = time\n",
    "- $\\sigma$ = volatility of the underlying asset\n",
    "- $r$ = risk-free interest rate\n",
    "- $V(S,t)$ = option price as a function of asset price and time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The price of the underlying asset follows a geometric Brownian motion with constant drift and volatility\n",
    "2. No arbitrage opportunities exist\n",
    "3. It's possible to build a risk-free portfolio by combining the option and the underlying asset\n",
    "4. Frictionless markets (no transaction costs or taxes)\n",
    "5. Continuous trading is possible\n",
    "6. The risk-free rate is constant and the same for all maturities\n",
    "7. The underlying asset pays no dividends\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivation uses It√¥'s lemma and the construction of a delta-hedged portfolio that must earn the risk-free rate in the absence of arbitrage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## European Option Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "### European Call Option\n",
    "The analytical solution for a European call option is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C(S,t) = SN(d_1) - Ke^{-r(T-t)}N(d_2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### European Put Option\n",
    "The analytical solution for a European put option is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(S,t) = Ke^{-r(T-t)}N(-d_2) - SN(-d_1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_1 = \\frac{\\ln(S/K) + (r + \\sigma^2/2)(T-t)}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T-t}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma\\sqrt{T-t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- $T$ is the expiration time (maturity date) (in years)\n",
    "- $t$ is the current time (in years)\n",
    "\n",
    "And $N(x)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$N(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{x}e^{-\\frac{z^2}{2}}dz$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Put-Call Parity\n",
    "The relationship between European put and call options with the same strike price and expiration is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C + Ke^{-r(T-t)} = P + S$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula allows us to derive the price of a put option from a call option with the same parameters (or vice versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpretation of the Formula\n",
    "The Black-Scholes formula for a European call option can be interpreted as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$S \\cdot N(d_1)$ represents the expected benefit of receiving the stock when the option is exercised\n",
    "$K e^{-r(T-t)} \\cdot N(d_2)$ represents the present value of paying the strike price on the expiration date\n",
    "\n",
    "$N(d_2)$ can be interpreted as the risk-neutral probability that the option will be exercised, while $N(d_1)$ is the delta of the option, representing the sensitivity of the option price to changes in the underlying asset price.\n",
    "## Key Greeks\n",
    "The \"Greeks\" measure the sensitivity of the option price to various parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Delta ($\\Delta = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S} = N(d_1)$): Sensitivity to changes in the underlying price\n",
    "- Gamma ($\\Gamma = \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial S^2} = \\frac{N'(d_1)}{S\\sigma\\sqrt{T-t}}$): Rate of change of Delta\n",
    "- Theta ($\\Theta = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{S\\sigma N'(d_1)}{2\\sqrt{T-t}} - rKe^{-r(T-t)}N(d_2)$): Sensitivity to the passage of time\n",
    "- Vega ($\\mathcal{V} = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial \\sigma} = S\\sqrt{T-t}N'(d_1)$): Sensitivity to volatility\n",
    "- Rho ($\\rho = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial r} = K(T-t)e^{-r(T-t)}N(d_2)$): Sensitivity to interest rates\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations and Extensions\n",
    "The standard BSM model has several limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assumption of constant volatility (which doesn't match market reality)\n",
    "- No consideration for dividends\n",
    "- Assumes European-style options (cannot be exercised early)\n",
    "- Assumes log-normal distribution of returns\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensions to the model include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Merton's extension for dividend-paying stocks\n",
    "- Models for American options\n",
    "- Stochastic volatility models (e.g., Heston model)\n",
    "- Jump-diffusion models\n",
    "- Local volatility models (e.g., Dupire's model)\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its limitations, the Black-Scholes-Merton model remains foundational in financial mathematics and derivatives pricing, providing the conceptual framework upon which more sophisticated models are built."
